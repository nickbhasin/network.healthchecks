## About

- **Ansible Network Health Checks Collection** provides platform-agnostic roles to perform automated health checks across various network devices.
- The collection includes capabilities for performing network device health, detecting failures, and recommending proactive maintenance.
- Designed for **network administrators, automation engineers, and IT professionals**, this collection enhances **network visibility, operational monitoring, and configuration validation**.

### Roles

The collection includes the following roles:

<!--start collection content-->
Name | Description
--- | ---
[network.healthchecks.bgp](roles/bgp/README.md) | Monitor BGP neighbor states and session status to ensure proper routing protocol operation.
[network.healthchecks.cpu](roles/cpu/README.md) | Monitor CPU usage to detect excessive CPU consumption and ensure device stability.
[network.healthchecks.memory](roles/memory/README.md) | Monitor memory usage to detect excessive memory consumption and ensure device stability.
[network.healthchecks.uptime](roles/uptime/README.md) | Monitor system uptime to detect system stability and identify devices needing maintenance.
[network.healthchecks.environment](roles/environment/README.md) | Monitor environmental factors like temperature and power supply to prevent hardware failures.
[network.healthchecks.filesystem](roles/filesystem/README.md) | Ensure sufficient disk space and check for file system errors that may affect operations.
[network.healthchecks.crashfiles](roles/crashfiles/README.md) | Monitor crash files to detect system crashes and stability issues.
[network.healthchecks.interfaces](roles/interfaces/README.md) | Monitor interface states and operational status to ensure proper network connectivity.
[network.healthchecks.ospf](roles/ospf/README.md) | Monitor OSPF neighbor states and session status to ensure proper routing protocol operation.
<!--end collection content-->

### BGP Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.bgp` role monitors BGP neighbor states and session status to ensure proper routing protocol operation and network connectivity.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [BGP Health Check README](roles/bgp/README.md).

### CPU Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.cpu` role monitors CPU usage on network devices to detect excessive CPU consumption and ensure device stability.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [CPU Health Check README](roles/cpu/README.md).

### Memory Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.memory` role monitors memory usage on network devices to detect excessive memory consumption and ensure device stability.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [Memory Health Check README](roles/memory/README.md).

### Uptime Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.uptime` role monitors system uptime on network devices to detect system stability and identify devices that may need maintenance.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [Uptime Health Check README](roles/uptime/README.md).

### Environment Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.environment` role monitors environmental factors like temperature and power supply to prevent hardware failures.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [Environment Health Check README](roles/environment/README.md).

### Filesystem Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.filesystem` role ensures sufficient disk space and checks for file system errors that may affect operations.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [Filesystem Health Check README](roles/filesystem/README.md).

### Crash Files Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.crashfiles` role monitors crash files on network devices to detect system crashes and stability issues.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [Crash Files Health Check README](roles/crashfiles/README.md).

### Interfaces Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.interfaces` role monitors interface states and operational status to ensure proper network connectivity and identify potential link issues.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [Interfaces Health Check README](roles/interfaces/README.md).

### OSPF Health Check
The `network.healthchecks.ospf` role monitors OSPF neighbor states and session status to ensure proper routing protocol operation and network connectivity.

For detailed documentation, features, and examples, see the [OSPF Health Check README](roles/ospf/README.md).

## Requirements
- [Requires Ansible](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.healthchecks/blob/main/meta/runtime.yml)
- [Requires Content Collections](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.healthchecks/blob/main/galaxy.yml)
- [Testing Requirements](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.healthchecks/blob/main/test-requirements.txt)
- Users need to include platform-specific collections as per their requirements:
  - [arista.eos](https://github.com/ansible-collections/arista.eos)
  - [cisco.ios](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.ios)
  - [cisco.iosxr](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.iosxr)
  - [cisco.nxos](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.nxos)

## Installation

To consume this **Validated Content** from **Automation Hub**, add the following to your `ansible.cfg`:

```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/validated/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```

Utilize the current Token, and if the token has expired, obtain the necessary
token from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

With this configured, simply run the following commands:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install network.healthchecks
ansible-galaxy collection install network.bgp
```

## Testing

The project uses tox to run `ansible-lint` and `ansible-test sanity`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/network/bgp`, run:

```shell
  tox -e ansible-lint
  tox -e py39-sanity
```

To run integration tests, ensure that your inventory has a `network_bgp` group.
Depending on what test target you are running, comment out the host(s).

```shell
[network_hosts]
ios
junos

[ios:vars]
< enter inventory details for this group >

[junos:vars]
< enter inventory details for this group >
```

```shell
  ansible-test network-integration -i /path/to/inventory --python 3.9 [target]
```
